**Simulation data:** Download a zip file of the pre-processed video clips at [here](https://github.com/THUHoloLab/STRIVER-deep/releases/tag/v0.0) or contact the authors through email. Then unzip file `sim_dataset.zip` at `data/sim`. The video sequences used for simulation are acquired from a publicly available dataset (click [here](https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/) to visit the original website). 


**Experimental data:** The experimental data can be downloaded via Zenodo at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17523561](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17523561). Then unzip the `.zip` files at `data/exp`.
